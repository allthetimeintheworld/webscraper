## Technology Stack Decisions

### Backend Technology Choices

#### Python Framework: FastAPI
**Why FastAPI over alternatives:**
- **vs Django**: Better performance, built-in API documentation, async support
- **vs Flask**: More features out of the box, better type hints, automatic validation
- **Benefits**: Fast development, excellent documentation, strong typing

#### Scraping Framework: Scrapy + Selenium
**Why this combination:**
- **Scrapy**: Excellent for static content, built-in rate limiting, robust error handling
- **Selenium**: Handles JavaScript-heavy sites, real browser automation
- **Alternative considered**: Playwright (newer, faster, but less mature ecosystem)

#### Queue System: Celery + Redis
**Why over alternatives:**
- **vs AWS SQS alone**: Better for complex workflows, local development easier
- **vs RQ**: More features, better monitoring, battle-tested at scale
- **Benefits**: Excellent monitoring, flexible routing, retry mechanisms

### Frontend Technology Choices

#### React with TypeScript
**Why over alternatives:**
- **vs Vue.js**: Larger ecosystem, better enterprise support
- **vs Angular**: Simpler learning curve, more flexible
- **TypeScript benefits**: Better debugging, improved developer experience, fewer runtime errors

#### State Management: Zustand
**Why over Redux:**
- Simpler boilerplate
- Better TypeScript integration
- Easier testing
- Smaller bundle size

### Database Choices

#### PostgreSQL for Primary Data
**Why over alternatives:**
- **vs MySQL**: Better JSON support, more advanced features
- **vs MongoDB**: Better consistency guarantees, SQL familiarity
- **Benefits**: Excellent performance, robust ACID compliance

#### Redis for Caching/Queue
**Why Redis:**
- In-memory performance
- Rich data structures
- Excellent Python integration
- Battle-tested for job queues

## Development Environment Setup
