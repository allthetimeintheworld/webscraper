   - React TypeScript dashboard
   - PostgreSQL + Redis infrastructure
   - Docker containerization ready

4. **🎭 Anti-Detection System**
   - User agent rotation with realistic headers
   - Request pattern randomization
   - Browser fingerprint management

5. **📊 Modern Dashboard Structure**
   - Job management interface
   - Real-time monitoring components
   - Instance management system
   - Data exploration tools

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### 1. **Environment Setup**
```bash
cd /home/jadyar/Desktop/webscraper
./scripts/setup_dev.sh
```

### 2. **Configure Environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS credentials and settings
```

### 3. **Start Development**
```bash
./scripts/run_dev.sh
```

### 4. **Access the Application**
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000

## 🛠️ Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup:

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Start Services
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL and Redis
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Start backend (in backend/ directory)
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Start frontend (in frontend/ directory)
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 Key Features to Explore

### 1. **Smart Scraping Engine**
- Located in `backend/core/scraper/base_spider.py`
- Features adaptive rate limiting, robots.txt checking, and user agent rotation
- Ready for extension with Selenium/Playwright support

### 2. **API Endpoints**
- **Jobs**: `/api/jobs` - Create and manage scraping jobs
- **Instances**: `/api/instances` - EC2 fleet management
- **Data**: `/api/data` - Access scraped data and statistics
- **Auth**: `/api/auth` - Authentication (placeholder)

### 3. **Database Models**
- **Jobs**: Scraping job configuration and status
- **Targets**: Individual URLs to scrape
- **Results**: Scraped data with quality metrics

### 4. **Configuration Options**
All configurable via `.env` file:
- Database connections
- AWS credentials
- Rate limiting defaults
- Proxy settings
- Monitoring endpoints

## 📈 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: ✅ Foundation (COMPLETED)
- Basic API structure
- Database models
- Core scraping engine
- Development environment

### Phase 2: Next Steps (Weeks 1-2)
- JavaScript rendering with Selenium/Playwright
- AWS EC2 integration
- Enhanced dashboard components
- Job queue implementation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 3-4)
- Multi-instance coordination
- Auto-scaling logic
- Advanced monitoring
- Data processing pipeline

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Weeks 5-6)
- Security implementation
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing
- Deployment automation

## 🎯 Immediate Next Actions

1. **Run the setup script** to get your environment ready
2. **Configure .env file** with your AWS credentials
3. **Test the basic API** using the swagger docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
4. **Explore the base scraper** in `backend/core/scraper/base_spider.py`
5. **Start building your first scraping job** using the API

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Dependencies Not Yet Installed
The import errors you see are expected - run the setup script to install all dependencies:
```bash
./scripts/setup_dev.sh
```

### AWS Configuration Required
For EC2 features, you'll need:
- AWS account with EC2, S3, RDS access
- Proper IAM roles and policies
- AWS credentials in .env file

### Development vs Production
This setup is optimized for development. For production:
- Use environment-specific configuration
- Implement proper security measures
- Set up CI/CD pipelines
- Configure monitoring and alerting

## 📚 Documentation Available

- `PROJECT_PROMPT.md` - Original comprehensive specification
- `FUNCTIONALITY_GUIDE.md` - Detailed use cases and scaling
- `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Technical roadmap
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Code organization guide

## 🤝 Next Steps

Your foundation is ready! The architecture supports everything from your original prompt:

- ✅ Intelligent robots.txt handling
- ✅ Adaptive rate limiting  
- ✅ Distributed EC2 architecture (foundation)
- ✅ Modern dashboard interface
- ✅ Anti-detection capabilities
- ✅ Scalable database design

You can now start implementing specific scraping jobs and gradually add the advanced features like JavaScript rendering, proxy rotation, and auto-scaling as outlined in the implementation checklist.

Ready to start scraping! 🕷️
